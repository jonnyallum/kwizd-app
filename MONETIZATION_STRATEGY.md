## The 3 Doors (Host Pricing)

### 🎯 Door 1: Free Trial
- **Price:** £0
- **What you get:** 3 full quiz nights. All features. No card needed.
- **Who it's for:** Any pub or host who wants to try before they buy.
- **Conversion trigger:** After 3 nights, the crowd is hooked. The host needs more credits.

### 💳 Door 2: Pay As You Go (Credits)
- **Price:** £16.80 per quiz night
- **Bulk discounts:**
  - 10-pack: **£140** (£14.00/night — save 17%)
  - 52-pack: **£780** (£15.00/night — save 11%)
- **Credits never expire.**
- **What you get:** Unlimited players per session, 70+ AI-generated questions, full browser-based experience, QR join codes.
- **Who it's for:** Pubs doing 1-4 quizzes per month. Freelance quiz hosts. Occasional events.
- **Why it works:** Matches SpeedQuizzing's credit model (hosts already understand this). 20% cheaper on single buys, up to 33% cheaper in bulk.

### ♾️ Door 3: Unlimited (Subscription)
- **Price:** £39/month (£468/year)
- **What you get:** Everything in Pay As You Go, PLUS:
  - Unlimited quiz activations (no credit counting)
  - Branded leaderboards (pub logo on screen)
  - Analytics dashboard (attendance trends, popular categories)
  - Multi-venue support (one account, multiple locations)
- **Who it's for:** Pubs running 2+ quizzes per week. Quiz chains. Serious hosts.
- **Unit economics:** At 2/week = £4.88/quiz. At 4/week = £2.44/quiz. Insane value.
- **Discovery strategy:** Do NOT show this on the main pricing page at launch. Let hosts buy credits first, then surface Unlimited as a "save money" upgrade after their 3rd purchase. Classic SaaS expansion play.

## Player Prime (B2C — Separate From Host Pricing)

> Players ALWAYS join and play for free. Prime is cosmetic-only. No pay-to-win. Ever.

### One-Off: £1.99
- Custom buzzer sound
- Animated avatar
- Neural Profile (personal stats page)

### Monthly: £4.99/mo
- Everything above, plus:
- Season badges (visible on pub screen during games)
- City leaderboards
- Streak highlights (animated entry when you're on a winning streak — other players see this on the big screen)

### Discovery Strategy
- NOT on the host pricing page
- Players discover Prime organically when they see someone else's animated entry on the pub screen
- Trial Prime free during sponsored pub nights for conversion

---

## Corporate Events (Sales-Led, Not Self-Serve)

> Corporate is a conversation, not a checkout button.

- **6–50 people:** £599/event
- **51+ people:** £999/event
- **Includes:** Managed host option, branded questions, post-event reports, SSO for large orgs
- **On the pricing page:** Just a "Corporate? Talk to us →" CTA linking to a contact form
- **Why £599 not £399:** Corporate team-building budgets are £50-150/head. At 50 people, £599 = £12/head. That's a steal. They don't price-shop like pubs do.

## Add-On Revenue (Month 4+)

These are NOT launch features. Build the core first, add these when demand appears:

| Add-On | Price | When |
|--------|-------|------|
| Soundboard Packs (90s Hype, Sports Roar) | £9 one-off | Month 4 |
| API Access for custom integrations | £19/mo | Month 6 |

| 200-credit mega-pack for chains | £2,400 (£12/event) | Month 6 |

---

## Sponsored Rounds (B2B2C)

- Brands pay to sponsor a round within a quiz (e.g., "The Guinness Round")
- Players see the brand, winners get real-world discounts at the bar
- **Pricing:** £500–£2,000/month per brand (impression-based)
- **Margins:** ~40% (cost is just the discount negotiation)
- **Launch:** Pilot with 1 local brand in Weeks 5-8, scale to self-serve marketplace by Month 6

## Technical Implementation Required

### Supabase Tables
- `host_credits` — credit balance, purchase history, expiry (never)
- `host_subscriptions` — Stripe subscription ID, plan type, status
- `player_prime` — player ID, tier (one-off/monthly), cosmetic selections
- `sponsor_rounds` — brand, quiz association, impression count, discount codes
- `corporate_bookings` — event details, contact, invoice status

### Stripe Integration
- **Products:** Single Credit, 10-Pack, 52-Pack, Unlimited Monthly
- **Checkout:** Hosted Stripe Checkout (no custom payment forms at launch)
- **Webhooks:** `checkout.session.completed` → add credits or activate subscription
- **Portal:** Stripe Customer Portal for subscription management

### Credit Deduction Flow
1. Host clicks "Start Quiz"
2. System checks: Active subscription? → Allow. Credits > 0? → Deduct 1, allow. Neither? → Show pricing page.
3. Game starts only after payment gate passes.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Players NEVER pay to play.** Free entry, always. Prime is cosmetic flex only.
2. **Three doors only.** Free, Credits, Unlimited. No confusion.
3. **Credits first, subs second.** Let hosts discover Unlimited after buying credits.
4. **Corporate is a conversation.** Not a checkout button.
5. **No placeholders.** Every feature listed here must work before it's advertised.
6. **20% cheaper than SpeedQuizzing.** Always. On every comparable tier.
